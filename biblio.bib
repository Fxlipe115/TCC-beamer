  abstract  = {For one-semester, undergraduate- or graduate-level courses in Cryptography, Computer Security, and Network Security. The book is suitable for self-study and so provides a solid and up-to-date tutorial. The book is also a comprehensive treatment of cryptography and network security and so is suitable as a reference for a system engineer, programmer, system manager, network manager, product marketing personnel, or system support specialist. A practical survey of cryptography and network security with unmatched support for instructors and students In this age of universal electronic connectivity, viruses and hackers, electronic eavesdropping, and electronic fraud, security is paramount. This text provides a practical survey of both the principles and practice of cryptography and network security. First, the basic issues to be addressed by a network security capability are explored through a tutorial and survey of cryptography and network security technology. Then, the practice of network security is explored via practical applications that have been implemented and are in use today. An unparalleled support package for instructors and students ensures a successful teaching and learning experience.}

abstract="We propose an efficient large-universe multi-authority ciphertext - policy attribute-based encryption system. In a large-universe ABE scheme, any string can be used as an attribute of the system, and these attributes are not necessarily enumerated during setup. In a multi-authority ABE scheme, there is no central authority that distributes the keys to users. Instead, there are several authorities, each of which is responsible for the authorized key distribution of a specific set of attributes. Prior to our work, several schemes have been presented that satisfy one of these two properties but not both.",
